# ModAnalyzer
This is a Mod Analyzer. This application first gets the Minecraft info, then analyzes all the mods inside the mods folder, and if the application finds a mod containing cheats, it will print out which mod and the modified date of the mod.

If you want the src just DM me at "lrxh" (I was too lazy to upload src lol)
